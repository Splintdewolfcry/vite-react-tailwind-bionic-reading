# :notebook: Bionic ReadingTool 
A revolutionary way for guiding the eyes through text using artificial fixation spots to make reading easier. As a result, the reader's attention is drawn solely to the highlighted starting letters, leaving the word to be completed by the brain center. Bionic Reading attempts to foster greater in-depth reading and understanding of textual content in a digital environment dominated by shallow kinds of reading.
